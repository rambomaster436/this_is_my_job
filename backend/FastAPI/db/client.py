#this fichero is the gonna be the encharged of gestion the connection to our data base with mongodb the way of to connect to mongo db is with the module installed pymongo and we gonna import from pymongo MongoClient 

#execution: sudo mongod --dbpath "/path/a/la/base/de/datos/"
#we gonna import import from pymongo MongoClient 
from pymongo import MongoClient #qith this  MongoClient  now we can to create a variable called db_client #mongoclient is a class


#db_client= MongoClient().local#we instanciar this class Mon. this class can to receive a huge of parameters  if we go inside the class Mon. has a huge of things that we can to put it to start it the host the puerto etc and if we dont put it nothing in () by defect to the that it connect is to the url in what it despliega mongo local or be the localhost by that we dont write inside () no one url no port if we connect to a mongo that we've in remote then we've that specify it in there of some one way but in start we simply we create the client and it's ready and it's enough for what really we've of some one way a connection stablished to the data base that we've wake up the local, the exemplo practico to learn how work mongodb inside our project with fastapi inside our project with python is in routers folder users file in one of the examples that we made is simulate that we've that to ride an operation of lecture of writting of update and of cleaning and of elimination what is the cruz of a data base of users but we didnt have a data base how such had the array or be the Users_data_Base that we've invented us simply to represent of some one way that we had a data base with these users and we gone deleteing some one user modifyieng it etc so what we gonna try repeat this but now yes working with mongodb so what this fichero of users in folder routers of some one way if we want we can duply in and the own folder or well to change its name to users_db  because we gonna work already theorically with an api that yes gonna go against a data base the reason because we divide it all so because so in every fichero that we've here of our routers quiet specified what we made and quiet separed more understandable we gonna see how we let all this in the fichero users_db fichero 

#here there's severals intructions basely in db_client we'd all and we'd also our client we'd created in the part of routers folder by usersdb an usersdb and the of return userg_search of path  in the ObjectId(in this id ) was just the api that it connected to our local data base and ehat made requests what we di was good we consulte users saved users were capable of to update it we did differents things 
# our data base was there in db folder client file  that was in form of comment by there up in execution: this was before the impotation that we'd that execute in our data base and we copy all of execution: if we want can to put in the to search of down and we search the iTerm or in our case for windows Windows terminal and we make it click and we open there a terminal by if of some way we want it to make of other form and was simply we put the copied for the data base bu we delete from the part --dbpath " and we delete the rest or simply sudo and the path to the data base and we gonna open our own data base where we'd it etc in the files of the system or be the app that seem folder and we copy the place or address where we'd the data base and we paste in the terminal and what it's between "" in this case it'd be data folder and the path was to the data base the local was this data  and how this in start  with " it was already enough to get run our data base remember that in windows it doesnt use the sudo only from mongod paste with this it works already and it can to work so much in Windows terminal we'd by there  in the terminal the data base geÂ¿ot runed to the local by a side and our server has got runed local and the things that we could to make by example we could to connect to the data base in the local host or in the mongo that of leaf that in our case is runned already and we check out the users in the data base users is to say we've already all local working this is all what we wanted to develop with python now the next is the data base is local is to say only we can to connect the requests to the api only we can to connect if we come us by example in thunder client  get operation we delete the part all after user in here adn we believe that calling to usersdb or be we put in the part of up of query headers etc we put /usersdb well in there we've a calling to the users that we'd in the data base is to say all working in 1rst place , only we can to connect so much to the data base how only we can to release we the petitions to the Api because these requests to the api we see in the thunder client in the side of GET operation that they go against locahost but we want that any one person as a real project can to make it requests to my data base then in there there's 2 things 1rst the data base must to be in a shared server a remote server and all what we've programed in python our api and our backend also it's that to be then they'll be the 2 steps that we gonna make today in 1rst place we wanna make a small improvem because it gonna stay some better reflexed what we have by here, we'd the client of mongo  or be the db_client in this client file and to the client this of mongo in our api to the what we connected us to that data base ever we connect to db _client.local.the place of the data base because we basely know already which was that connection to data base that we've that to use of some one way well what we gonna make since ever we gonna us to connect to local by the less now same developing is what all the references that we've local we gonna already em to pass by this file of the client in the  = MongoCl..().local is to say what my client gonna be already a client that gonna to be get pointing ever to local and what we make with db_client is what the db_client wont gonna need already to be calling to local or be the operations for call to data base that needed to call .local wont need eit so what in all the operations in what we called it we can to delete it only putting now db_client.users like in the get operation before of Path this wont need to be calling local it'll go already directly where the collection that it wants that db_client get point already to local to the data base local so what we gonna search all the places where it put that .local and we delete it because now the main reference it's already the of the local data base the .local mainly is in the usersdb we save that userdb file and we gonna come back to release a petition to test that it continue working and it continue working in th thunder client equal, so with this of here Mon.. Client().local we've not it that to repeat because we makes already reference to that client in the local or be in the Mon...().local our next step is our local data base fo what we see we now gonna come to the terminal that we'd open or what we open the of PowerShell app and we gonna stop the local data base we stoped the local data base every time that we wanna test that is stoped we release a petition in thunder and we see that it stay processing the local data base is not working we stop it to ensure us that the local we dont have already it runing a data bae because the 1rst step for desplegate our project in production will be to can to ride that data base in production in the thunder we can to make many things there's a simple a enough operative the data base that we were using was mongodb that data base is maybe the data base no relational more used and more known of the world we what did was download the client of mongodb to can to execute an instance of that data base in local for us to develop without no one problem without to have that to connect us to no one side and for what we if we break the data base broken the of local and it doesnt load us the of production so what we now the next that we gonna make is to simulate that we now gonna have a data base in production we gonna create a data base in production real in the mongodb web page we've differents options we could to hire a service in a server in the server that we want and to have an instance equal that we'd it in local well to have an instance runing of mongodb in a remote machine and we'connect us to the remote machine that'd be an option other option would be by example doquetizar everything is to say to work with containers to create a image of what we've in local and to desplegate it in a server it might to be we could to desplegate our mongo db in a server also but the people of mongodb from ago a season is talking much of its own service of data base in the cloud then we create that is well what we give it an eye to this service and so we also can to see and also we understand how it works the to create a mongodb in the own web of mongodb a mongodb in the cloud authoadministrated by the servers inside mongodb that we'll see all what we can to make we'll see already because is super easy to make all and it saves us a huge of work and it's part free is to say we gonna use the tire free of course if we'd have a data base super big well clear it might to reach to pay or whatever but in start of what it try is what we gonna use all the free we see in the final part of the web page of mongodb we see that in that part they put examples of differents industries that can to be using this customer stories good all the people that is using it and what they say us a little all the processes good to look that if is forbest toyota etc etc differents industries that are using this same service this same service is what the people of mongodb it calls it cloud Atlas or be the of the web page basely is like the service that they try you to trade of 1rsts we have us get down in local but yes that is certain what basely yes we give it start what they offer already us is to create a data base in the cloud because so we dont have already that to be managing local they gonna give everything all the system and encima is free so what we gonna see how to ride a data base in mongodb in the cloud for what our client our api in local it doesnt already release for the data base that we've in local if no that it gonna already to the cloud so what the 1rst that we've that to make us is simply to get logg us if we logg us in mongodb or be sign up well good we gonna to end in some blank with some one options also to build a data base that is the console of Atlas this is simply to make it in ther there's no more it's not more mistery that to make logging and it's already what we'd have3 that to make once we've the part of login good it gonna asks us some one datas very simples in plan to put name to your organisation register yourself with an user and password without more and the next what we'll can already to make is to create a project for that we push the button New project in our case is in the part left up were it says project to the side of an item of a folder and we make it click there and we choose New project  this can to change with the time so what we've that to search the button of new project so what we gonna give it in that button to create a new project and we gonna call it in Name Your Project space with the name Bears data base and so ti gonna calls self that project and we give to next in down and when we push it it says me to whom we wanna give it permisson in that project it appear in the initial part in Add Members.. space because it a to be more people whatever then good in start for me and it's ready we're in the side left of project Owner or be Owner and under Add Mem... space with our email with what we've register selves and we could to invite more people but in start the only that it gonna asks us is that a name of the project and we create the project in the part of down button create project we push and ready with this we're making the 1rst step that is to ride a data base in the cloud and we push the button appear us a new windows what says Database Deployments and it says what happen here withe data base in our case create a deployment and other like App Sercices in the interface Data Services and the Build Database button appear in the left side in Database push and will appear you that button in some one case appear to us what happen in there with the data base i the part of up i red color the message with the ip in what we're connecting this we'll see but it mean that we iven if we wanna make tests we could to limit to what this data base only it can to connect the machine what have our IP for what nobody can to access or if no we can to open to all the world that message says Current IP Address not added and it's already what we gonna make is we dont have alredy no one data base there in start the only that we've is the project that that basely doesnt mean nothing we've an option in network Access in the left side of the page and we push it that'd be the part to say add in IP dont add my IP we add all good it has already a huge of options  like peering private endpoint etc but we'll see what we end making with that because in really we what want or we can to make the test with IP and after what w can to make is to open that api for all the world and we come back to Database option of the left and we gonna create our data base then we push the Build Database button in there for that remember that this is some that we did already in local this is almost to try to make the same that we made that was our local data base we see that there's a data base dedicated a D B serverless and the free and what it doesnt ask no credit card no nothing that happen what that is a solution professional then reached to a professional solution if we've a server well we've that to pay by the server by the keeping by electricity etc good then it's not no one spend that we were not to have of other form still so they give us the posibility of to can to use and to can to create a free data base and by that we push the create in FREE data base with title Shared and when we oush it appear us a juge of options an we give name to the group what in its case it calls cluster and once tat we put the indicated we pass to the next where will appear is for create an username and password also there's the option to create authogenerated password all that to create an User , and we'll see the next an option to create a mongo db anyone oeople that work with mongodb can to say what we make normally well we gonna us to a servver in the cloud to anyone sas that is by there whatever and we start to mount all because many times we've not our own server or still is more we dont trust in our own server adn we hire services in the cloud the most big part of the industries has services we see in the part of up aws or be of Amazon google cloud in Azure are how the 3 big providers of services in the cloud of the world what it gonna makes us the people of of mongodb and cloud Atlas is to give us the freedom to what we choose where we wanna ride our instance of mongodb it's not already that we're hospedando the data base in mongo NO if no it's to say they are giving us the tool for to create the process for what this data base is in a servers more that known that can to be the aws google cloud the of Aazure what we wnat it depend of wht we wanna make the most used of the world we know already that gets loose to be aws and it's not already what we can to choose aws googel cloud or Azure is what we can it to choose adn we can to say in what zone we want to hire the machine or be in the cloud or be in the recommended region we can to choose the zone to hire that instance shared where it gonna install the mongo db or be what we choosed before already in EEUU this we must to choose keep on neary to our because this work ho all if this this point more far ofwhere we conssume well can to have a latencia bigger can to late more time in to answer so what we choose the most near if we gonna us to google cloud there's other options equaal with the rest what we want basely we put aws and we select what suits us better even untill it's detectating it us and it's saying us where we're nearer but i there we've we've it even there's some one but what yes that they'd let us to hire but what they'd be already of payment by how work these zones in aws some one are not updated still becauseall the services of aws still it's not replied in others zones just a part it doesnt care is to say to access to the cpd of others countries near is nothing with such what it's nearand we choose already and down we've the tier free but it says already us we can to create with the tier free with tier we must to stay with the datas that it give us free the people of mongo and there it says 500 connections maximuns 100 data base 500 collections is to this is to create a data base rather good 512 megas now for cover 512 megas in a data base no sql there's that to put it datas we adelantate it and if not we see in the part of down that even ther's there 2 gigas by price is to say of to want to ride a professional system because this is a project super cool that we gonna create adn what whatever it needs more resources we see already that the prices arent high aare very assumables and to the final are environments of high availability that it authogestionate super well that to scale super well that with 2 clicks we gonna create a mongodb in aws without complications if we'd have it that to make to hand it'd be very compleate when we've already all this we can to give a name to the cluster in our case BEARSDatabase even we could to program a bock up that would be in Additional Settings and we put with click in activate the turnon bockup but we dont make it this time and once we've all that we give it to Create Cluster but remember this depend of the version in the of our doesnt appear some one things and once clicked that we pass to the next page in Security Quickstart then we've it already in there then our data base of some one way or our instance or our machine it's already created so of esay untill that point to go with a clicks now we go by the Security page and it say us that we've a data base of course for to connect to it we've that to dafine an user and a password so what obviously this gonna be of tests we'll put what we want we'll make of way safe we can to put in certifies even we see already that it's by user and password but even might to go a certify vy there in the part of up where it says certificate there when we push appear to put a certificate is to say that is an environment totally sure we how we gonna be to testing all that we gonna test the username and the password with the same data even we can to put for dont forget it and we test it and we go to down and it says us by there in under where would you like to connect from? in the 3 for completeit or 2 spaces and what happen with the IPs that it can to connect we're in a test environment we want that it connect any one people then we choose among those an now in the 1rst of the 3 is when wecould to say well that only it connect our IP to test or if not well that it connect anyone IP in our case to say it that it add my IP doesnt happen nothing to me it gives me equal that it add our IP or be in the third that wasnt a space if not a button we push it Add ny current IP etc and if not wewe'd put the 0000 that that what would mean is what it gonna allow connections from anyone IP so what once we've all already or be if we create the user and add the address and we push the finish and close button the next would be already the part of it's already created we can to look the new page in there we see it's already created and remember when we end and we pass to the next then we must to go to Database in the left part because if not it gonna put you in the deplodewe see the the aws region in REGION after the cluster name what if the bockups are inactives whatever and if we want to give it more resources to the machine well simply we push the button Upgrade whatever there's no one problem for connect selves we've already the data base we could to give it in Browse Collections in the part of up we push it and we'll open collections with huge of options more up to look and we see that there's no collections and it says in that option window if we want can to add a datas of test to the data base in the Load a Sample Dataset button or if not also we could to add our own data in button Add My Own...in our case that of browse collection we dont gonna touch it because we wanna add datas from local so what we gonna see what things we'll have that to make in this case what will be the next we've already the data base of some one form deplegated for us the next is what we'll have already that to connect us to it and the way how we'll make to connect us is we'll have that to search which is the url of our data base well in overview or be in the options of up of the page web appear the overview there apart that what we see all the of the window region etc if we gonna our data bases or be we push the blue of up of Cluster() in blue we go to the last where it says >DATABASES and we push it and it gonna reach us to Database Deployments in that web page we've an button that says us in there in the part of up of Enhance Your Experience to gether to View Monitoring to its eft and we push that Connect button and will appear us a window where we gonna see all the information for can to connect selves connect yourself  from MongoDB Shell connect from an application etc are the options and we makes the 1rst test from vs code and we push that then we come to the new page and it says us the URL is the of 3 Connect to Your MongoDB deployment in under of where it says Paste your connection ... it says it that we've that URL Mongodb+srv..test:the user and the password there's that to put it in that URl and we've as a scheme already already a data base that it calls BEARSdatabase so what we gonna to copy all that URL and we gonna go to our mongdb to my visual studio code and we gonna go to the place where before we connected selves to our local data base local or be to the mongodb in the visual studio code and we click left adn we push the option Disconnect for what we disnonnect selves remember Remove Connection take off the connection of data base or be dissapear the square of the leaf so what it's not recommendable we were against localhost but we know already now we dont have waked up the data base we see what it fail#->
#-> in the part of right down when we disconnected the data base it says us Unable to connect: to connect etc we've not already a data base running in local but now what we've it is a data base in remote so what we gonna connect selves in the part donw left the leaf we push it to that data base in remote and we push the Connect and we paste the data base or be the URL copied and it has that to be the data base that the user was BEARSdatabase and the password was what we puts in the data base that mean that we must to change the username by our username that we puts and the password that we puts in our case it seems that the username it puts authomatically with the name of our gmail account and in the part of pass word put it without < no > if not it doesnt get to run also in the part last of the URL that we paste we must to put the name of our username someone times this username it authogenerate only and ready we push enter with it gets already to run what we wrote there up in mongodb when we push Connect is the data base and will appear the new data base in the part of mongodb to tbe left with our name that we puts up of  our old data base what we used the local host also the picture of leaf go to the left and no to the right and then we push it the new data base and we've it already an we've got to connect selves to the data base remote and when we push we see that we've 2 data bases onw is admin and the other local and in local there's a file that it calls oplog.rs and it's already is to say we've deplegated our data base in production but we follow having someone problem what is what our data base by there in the terminal our service of uvicorn that was in there running now same what we indicated it in the client file of db folder is what it connect to the data base local or be .local etc but we dont want already that it connect to the local data base we want that it connect to the remote data base is to say to the URL where now we've desplegated in mongo Atlas our data base we gonna become the line of this file client of db_client= Mongoetc because that is the connection to the local data base we put in the part of up of that line of db_client a comment of #Local data base and now in its part of down of line of db_client we put other comment that it says remote data base and we put the new data base remore almost as the db_client = etc
#to get the id of the users is faster by the thunder client 

#remote data base 
db_client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://49007781:theniggerest1@bearsdatabase.uosgwta.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority").BEARSdatabase# we see what we'd have that to make for this new data base in the cloud or the mongodb cloud because it also gives us instructions so what we go to the web page again to the data base mongodb web page the what we coosed in the before war for make the connection to the remote data base from visual studio code but it says also for connectconnect yourself from an application in the web page or is the option in our case is under Connect your aplication in what it says Drivers and we push there this is in the same that the other what we made with the for VS code and when we push it appear differents options like Driver in our case an the way of to connect from an aplication is we put the Driver the driver is with what we're conneting selves in really we wanna connect selves with python and to its side in version we put the version of python with what we wanna connect selves in our case the most modern or be 3.6 or later and lower in the part under Add your connection etc says us well that is the URL that we've that to use for connect sithou more and it say use that URL of the way in what we connect selves and it's already so what we copy that URL and we come by this client file and where we pass it the URL remembering that we could to come by the MongoClient( and we could it to pass that URL we might to say the URL we want that be that between ""and how says in the message in the part of down of that web page under this URL replace the password that we puts instead of the <password>) in there goes all in clear and the way in how we could it to make well is to create environment variables taht stay hide and what we could to connect selves when we want etc we gonna to put all in clear for what we see absolutely all when we get up the code in this we 'll have that to put our URL of the mongo Atlas of all forms we'll let those lines commenteds to what by defect we can to release against local and where we were connecting is a in the part of the URL after the @ to this part bu to the data base where we could us to connect thouth after we could to create other or be in the web page where we got the URL we click Go back and we see the old page there we could to create others in there in the web page in the of option of VS code or of where we got the URL to connect the URL to connect to VS code in there it said us connect to your name of data base or be in that URl appeared /BEARSdatabase to that we mean that is the data base that we've in here this file created inside Mo...Client(in here)and we put to it side .the data base in our case BEARSdatabase but of course we could to create another remembering that when we were in .local of before in db_cletc we called it local .local but we gonna wanna connect to the data base that now is BEARSdatabase or be what we puts before then how that form part of our client in there we put it the name what we want and inside BEARSdatabase we now when we make the petition after it'll end already it making is well to calling by example in the users_db file is to users inside BEARSdatabase or be in what we equaled the db_client good we'll see what there's there because maybe we've that to make some one retouch then we've that in that usersdb file db_client.users etc well we gonna by client file or be here and we see server working in local the data base working in remote the next is what we could to make is to test it then we release a request in the thunder client and we see which is the URL to what we've that to connect to it then we search which is the URL that we believe that we could already a little intuir then we gonna see the instructions in the web page of mongodb by if in the window of VS code by if it follow us giving data by there and we go to the before with Go back and it says connect with you aplication there we push or connect yourself with VS code and it says us in vs code once we've all well even we could to make a request fo moment we gonna go searching in the rest of options to connect differents ways of to connect us and all those options says what we could to make it of its way and how we believe that will be the URL of connection to our data base is what we puts in the db_client = in (here it is we've already it in here) with that is enough and what we'll have that to put in the thunder client is in the part of where put the server or to the side of where we select the type of operation  we what we want is to know if it's understood a concept we must to give count of what happen in that thunder client that is our api of up that server or be to together to the Get or for select the operations is our server and where it's running that server is in local in there we've not that to change nothing because is as ever it is our server but of our modules that we made so what it gonna run normal how in the before data base we dont put nothing there up in thunder and it equal run because the DB it executed inside of the modules etc in there up in thunder client we're calling to our server to our fastapi that is running in our machine local what is getting run in remote is the data base and the data base we indicate it already from the client or be in the db_client = (in this part of here )which is the URL is to say we'd not have that to change nothing to make the request when we send in the thunder client Get operation and it says me 200 ok it doesnt make and it seems that is well 
#then we make more operations and it normal works how in the before data base but clear the IP dont change we follow against local what change is the rute of the data base that yes that we've it already changed but the request to the api follow being against our machine we're not making a request to the api against remote we go to the the part of the url or the server togueter and we change the /mongodb by the /url in get operation remembering that we'd a /url that give back a url what we puts and that url simply was our main fichero or be in the main file main fichero we open it and we see in the operation get("/url") under get("/") almost in the last part that served that url or be it returned it and that is runing in local in the part of TERMINAL we've it we see it ther that is in local and if we call to userdb it in get operation is when we start to consult users but we didnt put it still or just on at least one in the remote data base and we go to the remote data base and we leave of the of the windows of the options with close and we put in the part of up of where we were in Browse Collections option toguether to View Monitoring and what we've by there is nothing or it say nothing in there basely untill what we put a data base by that we tried to save our 1rst data basely we connect selves to a local server with the data base in remote with the post remember it makes the request of to save users and to put the user we must to put it with "username": "fsdff", "email": "afsd@mouredev.com" so all between {} how we sent already an user in the remote data base in the left we click in database in the web page adn we put in its part of up in Browse collection to see the users inserted it's almost equal than local data base that we'd already in post of thunder client remember is http://127etc no httpl o s in our case and when we send the user it gives back to us equal that the of local data base a 201ok or be the answer_code and when we wanna update the data base web page we just need to click in refresh in the part of up in the upper it's a button what has 1rst a picture of a rows in circles and after the word REFRESH with that we refresh the data data base or we get update and will appear us in the web page the new user with the same of local DB the _id but in there doesnt appear the $iod but in there it yes exist and in the part of the left in our case it's BEARSdatabase and its down is the collection that is user or its name is users and in the part of the middle or the body or its riht of that collection and with that we've it already in remote we've not one data base in local, and all the rest of operations works equal remember ever put REFRESH button for update and if we go to the data base now in the part of before or be before to push Browse Collection in the left data base we make click in that part or if we we're in the Browse Collection and we want come back to the before we just push in the Database option in the left and it will guide again in that part to see the data base in that part we see what now we've metricas all a huge of metricas that in local we'd not have are those lines what appear are the metricas like Connections these show us by example the data size etc and the amounts of connections how much datas is passing its weights etc and if we push someone i appear more detailed also if really there's many petitions in 2 seconds wen end of to mount that and we've already the DB we see getting run my server in local we see in the part of down of here in the terminal but what to us we'd like is what that was not alredy only a server in local if not that of some one way well the requests any one could to make it then the first concept that we've that to have clear if we now all this code of this server or these modules gets desplegates in a server the requests to the mongodb that we've desplegated they dont gonna make alredy selves from my IP or server from here of me they they gonna make selves from an IP of the server where they're or we're with the which the logic would be to modify the IP to what we can to connect or be in the web page we select in the left part in option Network Access and when we select that will appear us a window that says us Edit IP Access List Entry but when we put edit int he part of Actions the of down edit and there just will appear us the window this is in the last part of those option of the body or of the middle in the last option in the right there is the Actions in there there's an option for allow access from anywhere an in the parts of down appear us 2 cells to choose or put some in there we can to say what from anywhere we can to connect simply in the 1rst cell with the 0.0.0.0/0 on of that way youn must to put if not it doesnt accept it that appear like a picture we put there with the 0s and no one problem if we put it pures 0000 this mean that is allowing connections from anywhere IP and we push the button of down Confirm or also we let it so since in some one cases is puts so authomatically  and remember in up in the part of of that Network Access in the 3rd in status with color green it gonna loal by a moment and after it gonna says Activeand if we know the IP of the server where we gonna get up load  we could it to put in that IP also it'd be other option in the case of what that server to the final well if what we know that that IP be fix what it's not sharing it or what there's no there a dns that is moving things our next point is what we now we gonna have gonna have that to deploy our project or be all the modules that we've created for this baackend this it's that to go for a remote server for what this api instead to be exposed on our localhos is exposed on an URL on whatever in there in the web page of fastapi is is to go us to the documentation in the documentation of fastapi in the part of under Concurrency and asynd it say us Deployment and inside this we push in Deployment - Intro in our casen is only Deployment in there we push it inside there it says us differents things says us what in the option of the Run a server Manually or be what we can to get run our server Manually in that option with uvicorn that is what we were making or be in here down we to see it in the terminal in local we got run and it says us if we want we've a workers in the option inside Deployment that is Server Workers Gunicorn with Uvicorn in there we push it we've a workees there with a pair of servers too in the part of FastAPI cintainers, also we can to put in it to a Docker or be in the option under of Server workers - Gunetc in the FastAPI in containers - Docker option in that we push and we see what we can dockerisar a image of python to put in it all our project and to upload all this project or be all our modules or all this of backend to WS by example and it gonna get run all the context and we could to deploy it so is to say now we go in already in concepts of deployments that get loose to be rather transversals in any one platform is to say what we can to send it to ws of course to Azure of course to google cloud of course etc is to say to a huge of things what we've a server a raspberry whatever but mamong all the concepts and the what we saw that is easier also for explain in there it say us among one of the providers or be among all the inside deployments it say us it speaks us there in the Deploy FastAPI on Deta it speaks us about Deta and it say us inside that option when we push it Deta in the start in the info what appear in its part of down of that Info or inside it thhis provider of hosting is a sponsor of FastAPI in there in really says us Deta |ro curved| is a FastAPI sponsor is to say what really the people of FastAPI and of Deta work toguether to create an environment of deplohyment very fast and ver easy and there in under that what we said says us a little the steps that we'd have that to make for can to deploy in Deta Deta is a web page or a platform in our case when we put in the learn of the webpage of fastapi in the Deployment in the option inside that we push the Deploy FastAPI on Cloud Providers option adn inside it in the last part we see to the sponsors and there will appear the link for Deta wew page and we push it and will appear the platform Deta adn it simply say us that we can to deploy our idea for there and Deta is free and in Deta by example we can to deploy of way free microservices in the part of down in where it says Micro or well we can to search in the own google in python or in node it can deploy these microservices  we see toguether to the Micros in Node with Express in python with FastAPI with the whic is just what we need so what we gonna use that service that is totally free is super easy and any one people can to use it and so we've not problems of what there's a payment service or not and what we've a cofiguration super crazy if ot what if we wanna test we can make it with Deta directly that after we wanna pass fastapi to other environment whatever the of ever we can to use docker by example we ca go use cubernets we can to mount a server what really can to get run python and we get upload there the things whatever there there's no one problem so what we gonna see the instructions for can to deploy in Deta and it says us and it says in that option the 1rst that we've that to make is to have created a project with with FastAPI what we've already and the next that says is what we create a fichero that it calls requirements.txt and what we want it on root so what for we see it very well we gonna come us to FastAPI folder to our project to the root and we gonna create a new fichero new file inside the FastAPI folder with the name requirements.txt or be a text file->
#-> and what mean that fichero is what with that fichero what we're it indicating is what require our project for can to work because we local we know already we've installed python we've installed FastAPI we've installed mongopay differents modules that has made us lack for what our aplication work by example we're in the part of data base or be usersdb well we look we in usersdb file we're using the db_client but clear that db_clietn work thanks to what we've MongoClient in the client file and MongoClient is inside a module that we've installed in its moment then is a way of what in the moment that we get upload this project to the remote server what we indicate it in these requirements also it gonna install in the remote server because if we dont say it what it needs we could to get upload all this project but by example it would fail already because we've not installed FastAPI in remote and when we try to execute some of FastAPI well by example the import of main file that what import FastAPI  would fail already because it's not it then in the requirements.txt what we'd have that to make is to put in all those requirements that to us nade us kact is to say all the dependences that we've gone installing to teh long of the project in that file .txt if we make memory the 1rst what we installed was fastapi so what we put in that file .txt fastapi the next what we installed already for themes of authentication was python-jose so what we put to the next file that python-jose that is some that we saw all and what this in local we've already it working but what we now also want that it install in the server we install also passlib in tehnext line we install to can to connect us to mongo the mongopay or pymongo and there's some that gonna makes us lack also what by defect is not installed in the server and what we yes that we've it in local what is python-multipart for can to make requests from the server well of the form to the what it mount in the server by the requests also it makes em with multipart and they ask us this dependence python multipart then in the moment that we've this well it's already with big freeze is putting us by there because that to the final what we've is how that context of what we've installed and it puts in it requirements we could to make it also so but good simply for explain stepd by step of what go all this because with big freeze we could to install us more things and really we've not mounted there an environment i .txt file good in really those what we've installed in that txt are what we've needed then we of that form surer already that when we get upload this to the server well also it gonna install all the of that file txt equal that we'd it installed the local and we gonna stop our server the server the local for what we see what now yes work it doesnt gonna be because this is running we've already the the process stoped or be the of down in the terminal and we go to FastAPI web page we gonna follow seeing that it says us and we see that it says us good what we create the fichero fastapi in there says us put in it fastapi but good we need others dependences by that we've puts in it the next that asks us in there is what we register self in Deta this is to make a logging it's already is free it doesnt ask ansolutely nothing and the next is to get down us the client of Deta for to can execute it from a terminal so what in there says us that we've that to make for download the client of Deta so much in Mac as in Linux as in windows and we pick up the of windows depending of your operative system and we copyn its link to download the client of Deta and we come to the terminal iwr https://get.deta.dev/cli.ps1 -useb | iex of here of visual studio code and we sticked it and we push enter remember this is that link iwr https://get.deta.dev/cli.ps1 -useb | iex and when we push enter will appear a letters with an environment blue sky and after that will appear Deta was installed successfully to file direction and the next line will be ...to get started we puts the link in the terminal of visual studio code to execute it simply to what we can to get run differents commands to execute in the environment of Deta from local a client without more then good in really with that done we've already it installed then it says us that we've installed it already in teh terminal but what all is correct remember also that when you pushed enter only runed a lot after stoped the next step that we'd have that to make is to go to the fastapi web page and there it says you've installed the client then says us test to execute deta --help to see if really it let you to execute Deta and we copy that or be the deta --help and we test it in the terminal and in our case seems that yes it finds it and in the terminal appear many things from clone and others untill Use "deta [command]" some one times the terminal doesnt find it and that is because really we've that to open other console or be clear the terminal or not whatever only try to see and when it finds it's already it's to say if we ended of to install well equal can us pillar the context simply we can to close to open a new terminal and already it's us it that pillar and it says already us in there is deta but we say it the help but we're not it explainig passing no one command the next is now from the client we've selves that logear in deta for that we've that to write deta login in the terminal and execute it and it simply gonna open me the explorer by the browser of windows and it gonna says me what we authenticate selves is to say it gonna wake up us an explorer there if we're not authenticated in teh web i n our case we were it already well without more it says me already that we're authenticated and we wait to what it says me what we're authenticated in the terminal it says us already logged successfully the next thing what we've that to make is deploy already we desplegate already if all goes well our project it says us by there there's differents commands there they put us the most simples we could to put deta new and the name of the project whatever if we put directly deta new in the terminal what it gonna make is pillar the name of our project this executing it ever from the root the requirement.txt file has that to be where we've our main.py file that is the fichero main that we gonna execute and we execute the deta new remember the deta new it must to execute in the root or be from the folder backend and we give us count of what we're not in the root so what we gonna to the root that is cd FastAPI and with that yes

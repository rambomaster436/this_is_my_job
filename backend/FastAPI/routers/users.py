#Api for users 

#In this case of api we can to separe if we want for become it more andarstable we could become in 2 apis differents for users and for user
#REMEMBER TO RUN A SERVER YOU NEED TO PUT THE UVICORN IN THE FILE THAT YOU GONNA TO USE

#we cant to have syncronas in our api because it'd mean that every time that somebody does a petition would block the operation of the server and would block the ejecution that reach new petitions #it's asyncrono by definition
#python 3.11 is faster 
#mongotv and fastapi is resources free
#it's almost the same that the other but withb /users
#apart of FastAPI we must import from pydantic import BaseModel for server of for users  for that we work with an entity that serve for define users

#here we put BaseModel in the item User(BaseModel) to do use of it 
#BaseModel help to what we dont have that create the structure to hand instead of down 2 hand done BaseModel build it alone#if we can possess an objec that implement the behavior of BaseModel we can already drive it how if it was a json directly fastapi gonna in charge of the object with beahvior of BaseModel without problems

        return {"error":"didnt find the user"} #we can also return an json with a dictionary and his gonna be in the server#in except we do return of vacume, in this the server gonna give back the ""

#the criteries to get datas usually form part of the URL now we're going to go to oanother operations type 
#we have many operations that form part of the protocole http is the protocole of conmunication that we have in this type of APIS is a standar that allow us conmunicate through internet 
#there's a advantage to use parameters and queries in the URLs we ussually use the path /1 when we considere that is an obligatory parameter 
#the URl may be dynamic or be can to be of differents ways like the /ID without the ? etc etc when ussually goes fix some it hgo in the path and no in the query ussually to use query normally we use it for parameters that are not necessarie to do the petition an example very typical is when we ask a user or a scroll or ask the 10 last publications sure that form part of the URL how a query and the pagination gonna form part of the query like give me the publications of the 0 untill 10 we can to be in the 7 or 8 publication and we ask to the api of the 8 to the 20 is the query is variable that can to change when ussually varia we use it also it cn to do others with query but is a good practce to do it by query in the /users/ is the path but in the /users/"1" is variable users in cahnge is obligatory 
#all this is how in the rutes /users/?ID=1 to concadenar we add & that go after ever of ? /users/?keyword=1&car=0 car is asking the element 1 of car #when we have that concadenar with a query we do example /user/1/?start=1 this say of the first user we want the first user list its start 1 and if we want concadenar or look for more we use &end=10&car=5

#we're going to see the most frecuents like post get put delete because if we understand how work em then we can advance more in backend to do it through of the documentation of fastapi with thi we have the bases
#get is for read datas, post is for create datas also save datas also to create a new user doing case to the api of users of some one form will be it, put is for update dtas of an user will be put because if we wnna change some concret we use a put and if we wanna delete (data) then will do it with delete 

#for what the post react when you send /user/ in postman or thunder you must to put a list User inside with all its datas in body to put it in thunder and to send

#error codes #we can return errors like 404 that didnt find the user this serve for give me count and react
#the messages are important to get interpreate or what the final user can to do some in answer and this is better with a text or a clue or key error 
#if even it return a 200 ok can be that dont return the asked by that we use the http codes 

#In dcumentation search if you want some concret 
#status codes there's codes between te 100 and the 199 to give us answer information 200-299 is for say that the things has gone well 300-399 redirection_messages 400-499 is what there's an error type and the 500-599 is what has petado the server and there's more codes one are sandar and the others let us intuir some with this we can do that the client intuya some because th user see the standar because in there there's no convention is some that we decide to send to the user 
#instead that if we work with the answer codes http there yes or yes we're talking of some tha if is puts bad then is bad, onother thing that you can to do by example is of the 200 and 299 where you can to do with the rest we can use yourself can write your own error codes for your user for what understand that did bad who use your api 
#there's codes much more often than the anothers and in the documentation of fastapi say it, like the 100 with information, 200 what it has resulted well 201 what what it's been created some 204 there's no contain when there's no to give back to the client, 300 tere's redirection,300 redirection, 307 temporal redirection, 304 a name fire, 400 that there's a error, 404 no found, 500 internal error that are mmuch less etc. The 100 doesnt use much and these told are the most used with these would be well to work 

#we create an api for products this of up is for user# remember for can run another api you must to put in uvicorn the new file:app
#we have no reference of the fichero principal of our bacckend by that when we havee run our api we've that to run 'em by separed we've no reference of our apis users no products for what in main we do it our main fichero for to do it we makes a group in main file where are the routers for that we create a new folder called routers where we the routers are all the routers that we can to have or be in our base URL the /users etc and we put the 2 apis files inside this new folder how 2 ficheros# we need to do reference from this fichero users so what if we create an api we've those 2 instances separed for that we create a router instead of an api that is main users etc but in really products in users work in general api or be for us it dont gonna be an api how entity in itself if no it gonna be a router so what in products instead import the FastAPi we gonna import the APIRouter and instead create FastAPI() we create APIRouter() and we call it router and we put in @ the new value instead of app 
# Wev go to the main  file and we import what seem that can work how router like the of products ##GO TO THE MAIN IN THERE IS THE INSTRUCTIONS all this is for what the main fichero is in the file main
